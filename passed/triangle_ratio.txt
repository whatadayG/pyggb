# Triangle with constrained sides measuring ratio of two sides
# Create initial point
point :  -> A
# Create second point at distance 8 from A
const int 8 -> side1
point_pm : A side1 -> B
# Create third point at distances 6 from A and 10 from B
const int 6 -> side2
const int 10 -> side3
point_pmpm : A side2 B side3 -> C
# Measure the sides
distance_pp : A B -> len1
distance_pp : A C -> len2
# Calculate the ratio of the sides
ratio_mm : len1 len2 -> ratio
# Output the final measurement
